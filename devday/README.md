# tl;dr

For GPT, put your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file, and then run `bash demo.sh` or `bash demo.sh beta` if desired

For embeds, try out https://pinecone.io + set `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_ENV` + an index named `lc-quickstart`

Download + unzip, read through the code, and watch the video / read more on: https://python.langchain.com/docs

## WARNING

The beta functionality allows the AI to run arbitrary code, which is why that's separated.

This is all hyper-jank hackathon "quality" code. Run at your own risk :P
